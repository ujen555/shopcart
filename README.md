## :rocket: Quick start

### Installation
 <i>General requirement</i> - <br/>
  In order for those projects to work, you'll need to have: <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>
    An IDE of your choice, but I'd really recommand Visual Studio code. If you do not own it yet, take a look
    <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"> here </a>.
  </li>
  </ul>

### Step 1: Clone the repo
- Either clone the repo or download the app and open the folder in the cli
- To clone the repo locally by doing -
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Midhunkumar-se/shopcart.git
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
  - Install all dependencies using the `npm install` command
  - To do so, open your IDE, select the persistence Project and open the terminal, type `npm install` 

### Step 3: Setup firebase
- Go to firebase app, create a Firebase project and register your app
- Install the SDK and initialize Firebase, take a look at the documentation <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup"> here </a>.
- Don't use my `firebase.js` file, which is inside `src` folder, because my firebase configuration is different from yours, please read the documentation mentioned in 2nd point.
- Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at http://localhost:3000/

#### And you are good to go
